Project Description/Outline: 
Our team will call an API with activity park locations around the United States and analyze different patterns, trends, and possible correlation based on region and state levels. We will include 8 different useful visualizations of the data.
Research Questions to Answer: 
What is the most frequent activity park type in the United States? How does it vary by different regions? Is there a major difference per State? How does climate affect the frequency of parks?
Datasets to be Used: 
Places API - entertainment.activity_park
Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
